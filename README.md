# FINAN6500DATA

This is a project for the FINAN 6500 Class at the University of Utah.
The goal of the project is to predict loan default with machine learning 
and write an app that loan officers could use to predict loans based on their inputs. 

The Code is written in Python 3 with the initial file being machine_learning.
The app aplies code written in the machine_learning file to predict but is compeletely standalone. 

If the code is used in other places please reference the repository.
