Please note that the Documentation PDF is slightly depreciated
while the gist of the message is still the same there have been a number of changes to code. 

The hyperparamters of the XGBoost Classifier have been updated this has a number of effect on the final output. 
The final accuracy scores and predictions have been increased and changed respectively. 
This is not yet reflected in the documentation I will update this as soon as possible. 

Thank you.
